## Description

Inspired by sophisticated project management applications such as Smartsheet, ClickUp, Atlassian, ProjectFox and other similar cutting edge softwares I wanted to practice my skills this time by building my own project management application. I introduce to you: SiriuS. 

In this application you can send emails to invite collaborators, keep track of all your invitations, manage collaborators, create and archive projects, share documents and more. For this MVP (Minimum Viable Product) I wanted to reproduce a minimum amount of features for the demonstration of the application. Also, I kept in mind all forementioned softwares and decided to keep the design simple and clean so users can focus the attention on what really matters. I used Semantic UI React as my frontend framework to focus less in CSS styling and more in the use of React functional components, Hooks, Redux, Rails, and developing the features I had in mind.

There was _much_ more I would've loved to add to this application such as graphs, charts, to-do lists, open/close ticket tasks, and other great features but it's time to focus on honing other skills and expand on what this app taught me. I will definitely continue to work and improve this project's code base and features as I grow as I developer.

This MVP was built with the intent to solidify foundational skills on React as well as Rails as an API. There is still a lot of work to be done and learning to do but I am a proud creator of __SiriuS__.

#### Inspiration

In Portuguese, we refer to a [crab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab) as a [_"Siri"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4PDorXSXEU&ab_channel=PronounceNames) (pl. _Siris_), and I used to love watching them as they walked in various directions, swiftly changing course to avoid obstacles (usually my cousins and me chasing them), then promptly scurrying back to the water, riding the waves and allowing the currents to guide them back to the ocean. This inspired me to explore the concept of a project management application that embodies both the serious nature of managing projects and the agility of a crab (Siri) in circumventing obstacles. Thus, I came up with the wordplay of __Serious + Siri__, resulting in ___SIRIUS___.

Managers and supervisors possess an incredible ability to multitask, meet deadlines, adapt strategies to accomplish new or existing goals. After all the challenges they face, they come to realize that they have given their best and achieved the envisioned objectives for themselves and their teams. They understand that there is nothing more to be done except to "surf the waters" and allow the unpredictable variables, like currents, to carry them into a new realm of challenges and possibilities. That is the essence of embracing __SiriuS__ .
